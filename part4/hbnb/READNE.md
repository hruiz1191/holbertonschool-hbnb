# HBNB - Part 4: Web Dynamic with Flask + REST API + Frontend

This project is the fourth step in the HBNB project, combining the backend logic of Flask with frontend interaction using dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to display, filter, and manage places with user interaction and live updates from the REST API.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **RESTful API** integration to load all `Place` objects dynamically.
- 🧠 **Jinja2 templating** used for modular HTML rendering.
- 🎨 **CSS Styling** and responsive design with custom layout.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Filtering** of places by price.
- 💬 **Review System** with user name, rating, and review date.
- 🔒 JWT-based login/logout system (visible in the UI).
- 🔁 Reload of places without refreshing the entire page.
---

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Run API backend

python3 api/v1/app.py

## ✨ Technologies Used

- **Flask** (Backend & Routing)
- **Jinja2** (Templating)
- **JavaScript** (DOM and AJAX for dynamic data)
- **CSS** (Custom design system)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **REST API** (for places, users, and reviews)

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Price filter dropdown may overlap if card height changes dynamically.
- CSS caching may require manual refresh (`Ctrl + Shift + R`).
- Currently only supports basic CRUD of places and simple review display.
